# Introduction
This project aims to address the following problems:
• The implementation of an autocomplete feature using the Trie data structure and Radix Tree.
• The development of efficient insert and search functions in Python for both data structures.
• The analysis and comparison of the time and space complexities between the two methods.

# Methodology
We used ‘time’ and ‘tracemalloc’ modules from Python standard library to record the time and memory usage before and after populating the Trie and Radix Tree.
